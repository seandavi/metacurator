# Specifications

**Specs are the source of truth. Code implements a spec.** (See
[ADR-0002](../adr/0002-spec-first-development.md).)

If you are an agent or contributor: find the spec for the component you're working on,
implement or extend **to that spec**, and add tests for the cases it lists. Do not
refactor unrelated modules — customizations layer on top of the contracts, they don't
rewrite them.

## How to read a spec

Each spec is self-contained and follows the template in [`_TEMPLATE.md`](_TEMPLATE.md):

- **Purpose** — what this component is for, in one or two sentences.
- **Determinism** — `deterministic` (no LLM, ADR-0004) or `agent` (judgment).
- **Contracts** — the typed inputs/outputs, referencing the data-model spec (010).
- **Behavior** — what it must do, step by step; the invariants it guarantees.
- **Errors** — failure conditions and how they surface.
- **Test cases** — representative cases an implementation must pass (offline).
- **Open questions** — anything deliberately unresolved.

Status: **drafted** = spec written to template depth; **✓** = implemented to that spec with
offline tests. Only the glossary (000) remains a template stub.
